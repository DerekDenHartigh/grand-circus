## Some examples from the DS & A lecture

Some suggestions for going deeper (no requirement at all, just in case you're curious):
- Check out the coinCounter code. See if you can extend the app so that it take in an input of how much money you have access to. For example, if I need $1.50 in change, but I only have 1 quarter, what is the optimal solution for me?
- Make your own copy of `mergeSortUnsolved.js` and try to fill in the algorithm so that it looks like `mergeSort.js` (No peeking!)
- Do some research on what other types of algorithms there are, and read through some famous algorithms, including:
    - Towers of Hanoi 
    - Kruskal's algorithm 
    - Dijkstra's algorithm
    - If you have any questions about what you find, feel free to ping me on Slack!

- Check out https://codewars.com/. It is a good segway to Test Driven Development as wel..
