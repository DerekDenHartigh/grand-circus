## Review, time for questions (0:00-0:05)

## User Interaction (0:05--0:20)
 - ngModel

## Exercise (0:20--0:30) 
 - Have each work on their own for this, pulling starter code from my GitHub repo. 
 ## Demo Exercise (0:30-0:35)
 - Have one person show that it works for, one person show that it doesn't work for
 - Be looking for students to make suggestions on each other's work.
## Filters (0:35-0:50)
 - Go over syntax, why filters are important
 - Show how they are similar to piping in bash (i.e., grep)
    - Point here is that this idea is used all over in CS
 - Show some examples of filters 
 - Orderby
    - Highlight the ability to either do simple alphabetical, or custom ordering (kind of like javascript .sort() method)
 - Spend some extra time on the "filter" filter, because it's super duper powerful

## Dependency Injection (0:50-0:55)
 - Basically just allowing use to utilize external dependencies while letting AngularJS do the hard part of handling it.
 - Will start to segway us into stuff like HTTP requests.
