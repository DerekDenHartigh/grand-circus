# AngularJS Part 1 Schedule 
## Getting started (0:00-0:05)
    - You are now all developers" pep talk 
        - Find ways you can solve every day problems with code
            - Share in class, Slack
    
## Overview of Angular (0:05-0:20)
### What AngularJS Is
 - Making life easier
 - Initiated by Google, open-source
 - MVC 
    - Won't get pedantic
    - Browser -> Actions -> Data (and back)
    - Demostrate using basic form submission (Code Demo + Whiteboard)*
- SPA 
    - Everything's loaded once (dynamic)
    - [SPA vs traditional](https://medium.com/@NeotericEU/single-page-application-vs-multiple-page-application-2591588efe58)
    - Easier to make hybrid apps (Ionic)

### What AngularJS Isn't
 - Is a framework, not a language
 - Frameworks still use the principles that we learned in JavaScript
    - More of a dialect
 - "AngularJS" vs "Angular"
    - Make sure to 1.x docs vs angular.io

### Building Blocks
 - Modules, code-splitting
 - Controllers
 - Directives
 - Component (not today)
 - Service (not today)
 - Configuration (not today)

 ## Getting Started (0:20-0:25)
  - Good tools for VS Code

 ## Modules (0:25-0:30)
  - At least 1
  - Getter vs Setter syntax
    - Dependencies can be third or first party
  - Start coding initial app using module*

## Directives (0:30-35)
    - Allows you to organize and structure your view easily within HTML (less custom JS)
        - Generally shoot for as little code as possible
    - Normalization
        - like-this for HTML and likeThis for JavaScript

## Data Binding (0:35-40)
    - Demo all in single app* 
    - Expressions
    - Math
    - Logical Ops
    <!-- - Filters 
        - Example of uppercase filter -->

## Example Time! (0:40-0:45)
    - Work as a whole group on initial part 

## Work on Extending Examples Together (0:45-1:00)
    - Give time to add their own extensions of it (math, string, logical ops)
        -  Groups of 2 or 3

## Break (1:00-1:15)

## Show Off (1:15-1:20)
    - Come together and have groups show some off

## Controllers (1:20-1:35)
    - Actions, feed in the data
    - Lightweight
    - Don't change the DOM
        - jQuery is passive, AngularJS is active
    - Deeper look at ng-repeat


## Data Binding (1:35-1:45)
    - Automatically updates information in view
    - Listens for updates both directions
    - THIS IS WHERE ANGULARJS IS SO BADASS
        - Google Search Bar
        - Google Maps input
    - "Build Your Avengers Team" demo
        - For Fake Extra Credit, make a PR

## Scope (1:45-1:50)
    - Root scope
    - Controller has its own $scope
